## ShoppingCart Kart

Instructions:

- Write a failing test that verifies the addition of items to the shopping cart.
- Implement the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
- Items in the store are categorized as `"Electronics"`, `"Books"`, `"Grocessory"`.
- There is a discount of `"10%"` available on the Books category.
- Write additional tests to cover functionalities such as `removing items`, `calculating the total price`, and `applying discounts`.
- Refactor the code and tests to improve readability and maintainability.
- Repeat the TDD cycle: Write a failing test, implement the code, refactor.
