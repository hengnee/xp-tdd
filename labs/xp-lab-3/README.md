# Collaborative Design Exercise: Building a To-Do List Application

Objective: Objective of the activity is to collaboratively design a simple To-Do List application using evolutionary design principles. The focus should be on simplicity, adaptability, and incremental improvement.

## Instructions:
- Join a breakout room and work with your cohort group 

- Application allows users to `create`, `view`, and `manage tasks`. It should support features such as `adding due dates`, `setting priorities`, and `marking tasks` as completed.

- Spend 10 minutes discussing and brainstorming ideas individually. Think about the user interface, functionality, data structure, and any specific requirements you can identify. Collate the ideas with your cohort.

- Select a spoke person to share your ideas with the larger group (5 mins). You can use paper, sticky notes, or index cards to visually represent your design ideas.

- Spend another 15 minutes iteratively improving your designs based on the feedback received and the insights gained from other groups presentations. Prioritize simplicity, modularity, and flexibility.

- After the iteration, each group will present their revised designs. You have to explain the changes made, the rationale behind them, and any trade-offs considered.

- Share your experiences, challenges faced, and lessons learned from applying evolutionary design principles in a collaborative setting.
